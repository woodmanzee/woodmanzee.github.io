You know those couples that are always traveling to exotic locations and write travel blogs and have lots of sponsors? Yeah, we're not one of them.

### Who are we?

We're Zack and Hannah, a normal couple with normal jobs and normal lives that are trying our best to still get out and see the world. We're an adventurous couple wanting to have balance between travel and everyday life. Travel can be expensive, but we want to show people that it can be done! Not all of us can sell everything we own and travel the world. Whether it's quick day trips, weekend trips, or full blown vacations, anyone can get out and enjoy the world we live in. Our goal is to explore our country and continuously find time to get out and visit new places.

### What are we doing?

Currently we are in the middle of a 45 day road trip across 27 states to see what this world has to offer. It took several months of planning and saving, but we made it happen!

### How are we doing it?

How is this possible you might ask? Luckily for us, Zack works for a tech company that allows him to work remote, so he works in the car during office hours and we explore the cities at night! To help, Hannah recently quit her job and became the designated driver/blogger.

Join us on our journeys!
