Hey everyone, we’re Zack and Hannah. Zack works for a tech company called Github and Hannah is a group fitness instructor.  We are a normal couple with normal jobs and normal lives trying our best to still get out and see the world, enjoy our hobbies, and live our best life. We’re an adventurous couple wanting to have balance between travel and everyday life. 

We are expecting our first baby early September and can’t wait to be first time parents to a baby boy! This is a space for us talk about our life and how we fill it, so feel free to tag along and keep up with our adventures; whether that’s parenthood, travel, and our quirks that make us... well….US!
