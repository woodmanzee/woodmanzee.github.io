With only a day in Colorado we had to make the most of it. So with that in mind we started off our day WITH a run! We gotta stay somewhat in shape with all this eating out we are going to do. My aunt and uncle live on top of this great hill. Wonderful for the view of the city, horrible for running up it. I was brutal but I did it.

After the workout, we headed to 16th street. We walked along the street with no destination in mind. If we liked a store, we would go in and check it out.

Zack found his happy place.

Then we checked out Union Station.

Honestly my favorite part was just to see the unique architecture from building to building. For example, for lunch we stopped at Avanti Food and Beverages. They use old shipping containers to separate the different stands.

Today was our trial and error day. We planned a few things but not everything out. We were left with a few more hours and so it slowed us a down a bit. We would find something we wanted to do but then found out that they were closed. Take a tour of the Pepsi Center? Closed 10min ago. Take a tour of the Hammond Candy Factory? Closed half an hour ago. Take a tour of the Denver Mint? Need a reservation ahead of time. It was really no big deal but we could have saved time driving to no where for a bit. That's part of the fun thought, right?

We ended up at the Molly Brown house. Yes it was about to close but we still saw the outside and went into the gift shop that was once the carriage house. From there we were close enough to walk to the State Capitol building and the surrounding area.
