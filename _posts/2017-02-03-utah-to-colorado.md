The story of us and our year of travel: A few months ago Zack and I decided to do a lot more traveling this year. Zack currently works at GitHub and can work remote; freeing him up to go just about anywhere as long as he has internet and his laptop. I was working for a company, IdealShape, and while I loved it, I could't leave for weeks at a time...so that left me with one option really. It was a hard decision, but I traded work for travel. Ya I know, rough life.

So here we are. We are driving across the US. 27ish states. 45 days. The plan is to drive through Colorado, then down to Texas and work our way along the east coast seeing friends, family, and cities that we have always heard about but haven't seen for ourselves.

I didn't sleep much last night. Maybe it was just nervous energy or excitement to get on the road? I ended up paying for that on the drive and was so tired all day. Oh well.

First leg of the journey: Utah to Colorado. 8 hours, 506 miles.

My aunt and uncle were nice enough to let us crash at their place while we check out Denver: my hometown!

Tonight on the menu: we found this little greek inspired restaurant called Bada Bing Grill in Arvada. We each got a gyro (finally learned how to say the dang word) and it was the best YEE-row I have ever tasted. To be real for a sec, I don't even know what kind of meat was in it. Definitely not chicken...or beef. It was sorta like sausage but maybe it was lamb?? I should have asked but because it was so good, I didn't even care. I also tried their greek salad, which I guess is just a salad? Not sure what part of it was Greek. That was also fantastic!

We ended up not even going into Denver tonight, I was so tired from my night of restless sleep that the idea of relaxing and talking to family was far more appealing than running around town. But we'll make it there tomorrow I promise!
