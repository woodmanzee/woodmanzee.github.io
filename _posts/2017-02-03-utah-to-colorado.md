The story of us and our year of travel: A few months ago Zack and I decided to do a lot more traveling this year. Zack currently works at GitHub and can work remote; freeing him up to go just about anywhere as long as he has internet and his laptop. I was working for a company, IdealShape, and while I loved it, I could not leave for weeks at a time...so that left me with one option really. It was a hard decision, but I traded work for travel...ya I know, rough life.

So here we are. We are driving across the US. 27ish states (give or take a state??). Just over 6 weeks. The plan is to drive down to Texas and work our way along the east coast seeing friends, family, and cities that we have always heard about but haven't seen for ourselves.

I didn't sleep much last night. Maybe it was just nervous energy or excitement to get on the road? I ended up paying for that on the drive and was so tired all day. Oh well.

First leg of the journey: Utah to Colorado. 8 hours, 506 miles.

My aunt and uncle were nice enough to let us crash at their place while we check out Denver: my hometown!

Tonight on the menu: we found this little shop called Bada Bing Grill; a greek inspired restaurant. We each got a gyro and it was the best gyro I have ever tasted. I also tried their greek salad..which I guess is just a salad? That was also fantastic!
