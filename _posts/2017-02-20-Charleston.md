Today we decided to use our friend's bikes to tour Charleston! They had a bike for each of us  and a truck to carry them so we loaded everything up and headed into the city! Charleston - as I later found out - is a great city to bike! It's one of those little big cities and because there is so much to see, it can be hard to walk it or drive and find parking! We first headed to Waterfront Park to eat our packed lunch. The bike ride took us through the historic streets of Charleston - through shopping, restaurants, cobble stone roads, and quiet neighborhoods. The streets were a little busy but the roads had plenty of room for us bikers to ride along side the cars which was nice because the sidewalks were a lot busier with pedestrians. That would have been a pain to share..I would have crashed into someone for sure! Within half an hour of riding we make it to the park and it was so pretty! The park sits along the river that empties into the ocean where Fort Sumter can be seen in the distance. The park had fountains, a nice grass lawn, and a boardwalk with bench swings (CUTE!). It was the perfect place to enjoy our lunch and feel the ocean breeze. I also might mention that it was in the mid 70s and sunny...really the perfect day!

> Commentary by Z: I think my favorite thing about the city is that because of their building height rule (that was recently repealed) they never built skyscrapers and attracted big businesses downtown. This left all the room for the charming houses and shops, which is far more enjoyable of a downtown to be in.

I could have stayed at the park for the rest of the afternoon but we needed to keep going if we were going to see the rest of the city. If you are ever in Charleston, check it out because it's gorgeous!!

We then headed to The Battery - a seawall that was once used during the Civil War as an artillery defense (kinda crazy to think of this place as a defense for war. It's so quiet and peaceful). Now a pretty sidewalk overlooks the water and has massive mansions. It was just row after row of these gorgeous homes with white columns, pillars, tall windows, shutters, wood panelling...basically a dream!! All of them were in amazing condition for their age and just so so dreamy (Have I used the word too much??). I felt like one of the emojis - you know the one with heart eyes :heart_eyes: :heart_eyes: :heart_eyes: I just loved biking through these streets and if they weren't millions of dollars, I would buy one in a second. I guess that's why they are millions of dollars...because everyone would buy them if given the chance.

Our last stop was Market St. to see the City Market. I've been here once before when I was younger but it was fun coming back and having Zack experience it! Have you heard of sweetgrass baskets? Well I had no clue what it was until I came to Charleston. People from the area weave these beautiful baskets made from wheatgrass..I wanted to buy one until I saw that a 10in diameter basket was $150! Who knew they were so expensive?? Maybe I will buy one someday but today was not that day.

For dinner we went back to Mt. Pleasant and headed to Shem Creek Boardwalk where the boardwalk overlooks the creek and restaurants surround the area. We watched another beautiful sunset (Charleston has gorgeous sunsets!!) and then headed to dinner at Page's Okra Grill - just around the corner from the boardwalk. I got shrimp and grits and it was probably one of the best shrimp and grits I've ever had! I don't get it _that_ often so who am I to say they are the one of the best...buuut they were dang good. For dessert Zack bought a slice of carrot cake (LOVE carrot cake) and this one was incredible! We watched the servers slice it up and Zack couldn't resist.

> Commentary by Z: I really didn't want to buy it... but something about seeing them cut up this massive, moist and dense carrot cake in front of me just tore down my resolve. It was amazing.

Overall impressions of Charleston?? I LOVED it! I'm gonna speak for Zack and say WE loved it! I fell in love with this city and want to come back again to explore it some more! I loved the charm, the history, the food and the southern feel. It definitely has my attention and when thinking about where we would want to live on day, this is on my short list.
