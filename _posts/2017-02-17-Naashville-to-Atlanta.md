Zack and I decided to save a little money today by staying at a motel which seemed like a great idea... buuuut maybe we should have spent a little more money after all. We are only in Atlanta one night so no need for anything extravagant - just something clean and above all, cheap! We thought about taking more time in Atlanta, but we are meeting friends tomorrow in Savannah so in order to make it on time we had to pass up really getting to know Atlanta.

The drive was going great. We stopped in Chattanooga (in Tennessee but right by the border of Georgia) for lunch and I kinda loved it. It was a lot bigger than I imagined with beautiful rolling hills and a lake just outside the city where people fished and relaxed in the nice 70 degree weather. Dreamy, right?? It made me wish in that moment that we had brought our Kayak with us on this trip to take advantage of that moment..too bad our Fusion can't handle a roof rack and a two-man Kayak on it ha.

Anyway, we stopped at St. Elmo Deli & Grill for lunch which had hot sandwiches! Yummy! It was in this cute part of town where they have a railway that goes up to Lookout Mountain (from our view it looked like a cute shed and platform at the top!). That would have been so fun to try, I'm kicking myself that we didn't.

As we got to the Border of Atlanta the traffic worsened. There is nothing more that I love than heavy traffic in an unfamiliar place! Honestly, I felt like the whole time I was gripping the steering wheel as I navigated around aggressive drivers. What can you expect from a big city though?? I get use to driving in the countryside so when I hit traffic I instantly tense up and my mood shifts from cheery to kinda cranky.

> Commentary by Z: We had to shift our music selection to something a little more cheery and upbeat...

We made it to the motel room which brings us to the present and back to why this wasn't the best idea. Ya we are safe, but do we feel safe? eh, not really. Something about my window and door right up against the parking lot doesn't give me the best sense of security. We also have neighbors that decided to have a bbq and didn't think to invite us! Rude.

> Commentary by Z: Hannah neglected to mention that their bbq is in the back of their truck and they're all outside talking and yelling at each other right outside our door. Super pleasant.

As the night goes on though, I can hear them getting a little more drunk and a little louder. Their radio is blasting though so maybe they were too nervous to ask us to join and thought that we still wanted to _hear_ the fun. Hmmm but as I write this, "Every Breath you Take" by The Police is playing, you know "Every move you make, every step you take, I'll be watching you"... I will try not to read too much into that.. Also, the neighbors upstairs are not shy! I can't tell if they are making it more homey by hanging up pictures on the wall or if they just like to play leapfrog haha. Well, it's all part of the experience, right??

_To make you feel better and let's be real, me feel better, here is a picture that I just love SO much! I laugh sooo hard every time I see it! I can't get over it and it only gets funnier the more I look at it! If you go online you can find countless memes/GIFS of this little guy..so that's what I will be doing for the next hour before bed._
