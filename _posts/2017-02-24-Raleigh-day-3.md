Zack and I love the mountains - hiking, camping, anything that brings us closer to nature. Raleigh doesn't have mountains but what Raleigh _does_ have is plenty of woods and places to walk and hike..or nature walk (not a lot of dramatic elevation change compared to Utah ha). Today we explored Yates Mill - one of the oldest buildings in the area now turned into a historical site and state park. The old mill was once used for grinding corn, wheat, and lumber which we learned _all_ about in the visitor center! The grounds are gorgeous with trails that not only took us to the mill but then allowed us to walk around the lake.

Side note - While we were taking a nice walk I remembered that I get a little jumpy....what I mean is that I heard something rustle in the bushes and jumped a little. Guess I need to walk in nature more because that shouldn't have phased me... :)

> Commentary by Z: Pretty sure she only confessed that just so I couldn't reveal it myself and do smug commentary about it. So instead of that, I'll just say that I'm torn between wishing I could have had a lifestyle like they must have had on the mill - working hard and building things and swimming in the pond on the weekends - and being happy that I can work on a computer inside my air conditioned house and watch Netflix with my wife at night.

After the mill, we headed over to Pullen Park which is right outside of downtown. There's a cute little train that families can ride, a pond with a boat dock, paddle boats, a playground, and a lot of grassy space! It would be the perfect place to for an afternoon with family or friends! We really loved it and bonus - it was free (unless you wanted to ride the train)!

Before the sun set, we headed to the Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Apex. We walked the grounds and enjoyed the peace and quiet for a bit but eventually got hungry..so naturally we headed to dinner! Tonight, we chose a place called Los Tres - Mexican food! I got steak tacos and Zack got steak nachos! I love Mexican food because they usually bring out chips and salsa to snack on...I always have a hard time not eating all of them and getting full before my meal shows up.

> Commentary by Z: Why is it that everyone serves Carne Asada Nachos instead of Carne Asada fries? I swear they're 10x harder to find outside of California.

Tomorrow is our last full day in Raleigh before we move on to Virginia! We'll probably go up and see Duke University and get our last taste of the city. See you tomorrow!
