Good news! The medicine is working and I should be back to myself in no time! Does it seem like I keep talking about my sickness...because I feel like I have, but man does it make me appreciate when I am healthy. Traveling and illness do not mix very well and I have had a hard time these past few days as I have tried to get better. It's hard when I'm not in my own bed and around everything I need to get better. It's been an adjustment for sure..so if anyone has any ideas of what I could take to help keep me healthy for the rest of the trip that would be awesome! I'm currently taking vitamins and working out - that's about it.

Zack had work so I updated the blog, rested, and even went for a walk with our friend's dog Romeo. This dog is like my dream dog - so easy to walk and so happy to be on a walk with you. I had a dog growing up and he was the kind of dog that wanted to bolt the second he was out of the backyard. He always took _me_ for a walk, a run really! That partially had to do with that fact that I was 10 and easy to drag around, the other part is that he just loved to run.

> Commentary by Z: He can't drag her around cause he's round like a sausage right now! Maybe a pepperoni? A peppeRomeo?

Romeo is such a good dog though that it made it easy for me to explore the outdoors of Nashville. Even in the neighborhoods it was pretty woodsy which I loved (is woodsy a real word?). It felt a little more secluded when I couldn't see house after house in the area, but I'm also not used to it. Living in Utah has made me more accustomed to seeing the whole valley in pretty much any location.

Tonight we tried to go see the Grand Ole Opry, but when we arrived they were having some private event so no one was able to get close to the building..it was all blocked off which was a bummer. Sooo we saw it from a distance but couldn't even get a good picture of it because the trees were obstructing the view :(. It was really cool to see but also surprising that a mall is right by it? I guess I always imagined it would be in the heart of the city surrounded by a park and sky scrapers or something. It was still cool to see...next time we come out here I want to go to a concert there, that would be amazing!! Carrie Underwood anyone?

We considered going back to Broadway for dinner but Tanner suggested we try an Irish pub, McNamara's Irish Pub and Restaurant, that plays live music. We figured we'd give it a shot since Irish music can be pretty cool (a little random but it's true). Turns out, we really liked that place! I tried Shepherds pie - for the first time I might mention - and I liked it! Shepherds pie kinda freaked me out for a long time..I have no idea why but it never appealed to me but when Zack brought it up as a food option I realized that it sounded pretty good so why not try it out? For dessert we shared a Ice Cream pie and the thing was MASSIVE! Four people could have shared it and probably wouldn't have finished it. It was three different types of ice cream with a chocolate crust and topped with chopped Snickers and chocolate syrup. So good. So filling. A sugar overload. I will probably dream about that dessert tonight it was so good, but also regret how much I ate.
