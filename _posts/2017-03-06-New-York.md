### What did we do?

Here's just a quick list of everything we did in one day. Yes. ONE. DAY.

- Central Park
- Brooklyn Bridge
- 9/11 Memorial
- St. Paul's Chapel of Trinity Church Wall Street
- Trinity Church
- Wall Street
- SoHo
- The Village
- Washington Square Park
- Chelsea Market
- The High Line
- Grand Central Station
- New York Public Library
- Times Square
- Lincoln Center
- Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Temple

My Apple Watch told me that I had over 32,000 steps _and_ we even used the Subway. We only had one day and needed to make the most of it and thanks to Lauren and Cameron (who came with us), we had the perfect guides since New York was once their home. Had it just been Zack and I, we would have spent half the day trying to figure out which Subway transfer we needed or where to go next. Cameron and Lauren helped map out the day to maximize our time. No backtracking necessary - always a plus!

This was one of my favorite days! It was a long and tiring day, but I love New York! It's a fun city with history, culture, beautiful architecture old and new. Its hard to pick my favorite stops from the day because everything was cool in its own way. I love how massive Central Park is and how pretty the grounds are, but I also loved the Brooklyn Bridge and Trinity Church for their architecture and history.

*side note, we saw Alexander Hamilton's grave at Trinity Church. If you still haven't listened to the soundtrack GO LISTEN TO IT!*

> Commentary by Z: Be warned - I listened to it several weeks ago and still can't get some of the songs out of my head. I'm ok with it, but be warned.

Living here would be an amazing experience and I kinda wish we did live here..then we wouldn't have to do everything in one day hah. There's always something going on and I love that.

### Where did we eat?

Levain Bakery: We shared an Oatmeal Raisin cookie and it was perfect...it was so soft and fluffy! They use extra gluten so for those of you who are gluten free, sorry, this is not the place for you! It's a good thing they don't have this back home or I would be in serious trouble..

> Commentary by Z: In an age of gluten-free, I DEMAND DOUBLE GLUTEN!

Zucker's Bagels and Smoked Fish: We couldn't just eat cookies for breakfast sooo we shared a bagel.
*definitly a cheat day on our end...carb overload*

Joe's Pizza: Classic New York Pizza! Lucky for us Cameron has tried enough to know this is one of the better shops in the city. FYI, it's cash only.

Doughnuttery: This donut shop in Chelsea Market had bite sized donuts! I had a bite (tiny bite since they are already bite sized) and they were so good.

> Commentary by Z: Again, WHERE IS MY DONUT FRIER??

The Smith: I got a Chicken Pot Pie, and it was a lot bigger than I expected! The crust was fantastic - flakey, hot but not too thick.

> Commentary by Z: Oh yeah Zack got gnocci, let's not forget about him on this blog.

Wafels & Dinges: A food truck that has some of the best waffles around. Zack and I shared because we just had so much dinner! It's cash only though so make sure you have some on hand.

> Commentary by Z: Oh hey look, I was there this time!

### What do we wish we could have done?
DÅŒ, Cookie Dough Confections: Instead of the classic scoop of ice cream, they offer scoops of cookie dough! I was so excited to try this, but when we got to the shop, we saw that they are closed Mondays! The only day of the week they are closed and the only day we were there..tragic. We were going to go the morning we left, but driving down there was going to be a nightmare so we will have to save it for out next trip.

Broadway Show: This would have been another amazing experience but we were so exhausted after a long day there would have been NO way.

### Final Thoughts

New York is one of the coolest cities. It was amazing to me to see so many different people all in one place. I loved the streets and even the Subway (I was kinda secretly hoping but not hoping to see a rat on the Subway tracks or something, but I didn't. Probably for the better). I will always want to come back to New York!

> Commentary by Z: So will I! If I'm invited!
