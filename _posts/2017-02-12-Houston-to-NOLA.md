#### _Another_ "Guest" post by Z!

Good news everyone! You get me again today! Hannah's still not doing so well, her throat is better but she's super congested and not quite up to speed so I'm secretly writing the blog while she's sleeping since we're a day behind. I'll get in trouble for telling you that, but that's just the way it is.

We got up early to go to church with Mark and Krissy (my aunt and uncle) and see a baby blessing performed by one of their returned missionaries who apparently wasted no time in starting a family! It happened to also be their Ward Conference, which was good for us cause the talks were great and the choir was a-MAZ-ing. It's like they were a mini-MoTab. They sang the MoTab version of Redeemer of Israel, complete with crazy harmonies and two-man organ playing. The power! The grace! The sheet music! It was really good, I for one was left in awe and wonder and with a weird grin on my face.

Afterwards we said goodbye and got back on the road again, heading down to see our friends Austin and Annie Grant in New Orleans! It's fascinating to me to watch the land transition as we travel from place to place. We started our journey up in the mountains, crossed through the Rockies, dropped down into the plains, went south and felt the humidity get thicker and thicker, and now turned east into marshlands and woods. I just love it!

We stopped in Baton Rouge just because it was there, and I had no idea it was on the way to New Orleans. Turns out, it was my favorite place so far! I really liked how quiet the city was - it was a bigger city without being huge and crowded - and how it had lots of charming southern homes right on the outskirts of all the big buildings. Was an awesome hybrid feel of city + country, I just wish I had longer to explore. We went to see the capitol building, which is unlike any capitol building I've seen but is also my favorite. After walking around the park and taking a few pictures we had to say a sad goodbye and get moving again.

Finally made our way into New Orleans, and I loved to see the way the architecture takes on that classic Nola style. I want one of these houses so badly! Just not a million dollars badly, which is what it would take to get one.

We stayed the night with the Grants, who were nice enough to make us an amazing dinner which we shared with some other friends of theirs who lived nearby. Nothing like a nice home-cooked meal to give you a break from eating out all the time! We chatted way later into the night than we should have, especially with Hannah being sick, but you know how it is when you're catching up with good friends. A 15 minute chat turns into several hours and 15 minutes, and before you know it midnight has come and gone.

Looking forward to seeing the heart of the city tomorrow!
