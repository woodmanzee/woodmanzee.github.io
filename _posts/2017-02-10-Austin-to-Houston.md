We just wanted to relax before we needed to drive to Houston, so this morning was somewhat slow. Last night we stayed up until 1 so naturally we slept in suuuuper late till... 7am. I like to consider myself a morning person...but more like an 8:30-9am kinda person. Maybe that's not so early after all, but it sounds good to me. Our niece had to go to school early and we wanted to catch her before we left so 7:00am it was!

Kids in the morning have so much energy though, I was laying on the floor contemplating whether I should take a nap or not and the two boys decided that it would be a great time to tackle me. Of course I laughed and said something about a 'storm' that was going to come and blow them off and before you know it, I am a pirate ship haha. Kids imaginations, am I right? You play along for one second and they take that and turn it into a whole game. I do love these kids though so I will play their game any day. When things got a little too rough, my sister (their mom) stepped in and rescued me before...well before I was hurt haha. I'm a little more fragile than the boys.

At one point they started coloring with Zack oh my goodness..be still my heart it was the cutest thing to watch. Zack and I don't have any kids yet, but in this moment my heart melted and I felt the beginnings of being baby hungry! SO CUTE!

> Commentary by Z: clearly Hannah is in denial because the "beginnings" of her baby hunger started long ago, but nice to know I can still melt hearts ;)

Saying goodbye

Driving to Houston. We took the more scenic route and it was weird to see the land change from a little hilly with some trees, to farmland (similar to Oklahoma), to suddenly feeling that I was very much in the south. The trees here in Houston are more dense and green and in the summer I can only imagine that they get covered in moss. The humidity definitely increased as well - as we were driving in the car you can just feel the humidity take it up a notch from one minute to the other... kinda weird sensation.

We made it to Zack's aunt and uncle's home where we ate out at this great TexMex place called Pappasito's Cantina. The chips and salsa were the best part, so addictive and you know why? Because they were thin hot crispy chips, lightly salted and the salsa had a little kick but not too much. Side note: Please never give me super spicy foods... I am a wimp when it comes to spice and I hate it when the burn lingers!

5th leg of the journey: 3 hours. 159 miles.
