We have been staying with my sister and her family while in Austin and it has been fun to hangout with their kids and relax a little before hitting the road again. The only think that really sucks is that we are only here two nights. Plus it doesn't help when they are just so excited to see us. When we pulled up last night we saw 3 little faces in the window waiting for us. When we got out of the car they all plowed into Zack and I. I mean, they really plowed into us and even hit me in the chin with their heads. This morning was basically play with the kids, take them to the park, and play games inside. The park was a little more challenging since I have gotten older... Yes I am stronger than all the little kids (thank goodness) and can show off when I can climb the railings and such (what cool aunts do) but my nephew wanted me to chase him around the playground. This playground is one of those more intense playgrounds, like it has 3 stories, several slides, a rock climbing wall, and other small traps that kids can climb on and possibly injure themselves. It started off easy, chase the kids around and make them feel that you are coming after them so they take off faster in the other direction. I don't have to use as much energy and hopefully in the process you wear the kids down. But what didn't help was that they are small enough to duck into small corners or pass through tight spaces and I got a little competitive and wanted to keep up, you know, show them I am still young and fun. I was wearing jeans and they just don't have the kinda give I needed but before you get any ideas, no I did not rip my pants ha! Thank goodness. I was just reminded that I am in fact getting older...I don't have the advantage of a tiny person that can dodge in and out of places. Oh well. I guess that's probably why I should have gone back to the first tactic of act like I am chasing them but I'm not actually chasing them.

Throughout this trip, Zack and I have been looking for our next place to live and I keep thinking I want to live close to a big city, but here in Austin, I am reminded why living just outside the city can be the worst...traffic! Tonight we wanted to go into Austin down by South Congress Ave. South Congress is a street the runs south of the capitol building (hence the name) and once it leaves the city and crosses the river turns into a really neat and lively place where you can find a bunch of funky shops, cafes, and bars. There were two stores I had in mind that I NEEDED to check out. When I was out here in Thanksgiving I didn't have time to stop and check them out so I knew this trip was my chance! We figured it was only a half hour away, but that half hour drive took over an hour which is a total turnoff. I really do hate traffic and because of that, we showed up at 6:30 and the stores closed at 7...crap. So we had to hurry between the two stores I really wanted to see.

The first was Uncommon OBJECTS. This store is essentially an antique store but with it's own flair of weirdness. I don't even know where they find some of their items. Like taxidermy animals in shadow boxes with some sort of scenery? I just wonder who the previous owners were. I want to know their stories and what made them buy the things they did. It made for an interesting store regardless!

The second was Allens Boots. It's like the mecca of cowboy boots with shelf after shelf of them in every shoe size and every color. You want some bling on those boots? They've got that! Maybe some fringe, snake skin, or alligator? Got that too! Oh, but I saw these boots that were like clogs...only in boot form with a pointed toe. I really have no idea how to explain them other than they were beautiful and perfect, but I couldn't justify $150 on shoes...ya, that's what I will keep telling myself to get over the pain.

Once all the shops closed we wanted to go out to dinner in the city, but after the past few days of heavy barbecue we decided we needed a break! Especially if we're going to keep eating barbecue in Houston this weekend. After much googling and tripadvisor-ing we settled on a neat restaurant called Viniagrette, which pretty much has an entire menu of salads. I got the Salacho which was fantastic - it was like a healthier take on taco salad. Zack got a Reuben and a Cesar "salad", which turned out to be entire leaves laid out on the plate. Nice to look at, not as convenient to eat.
