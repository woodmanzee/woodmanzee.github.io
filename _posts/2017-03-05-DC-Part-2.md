### What did we do?
Cameron, Lauren, Zack and I went to Eastern Market for breakfast and to look at the shops. There was this one place that had all of these original maps that were so old. I have a love for old maps so it was fun to browse and find ones from Colorado, California, and pretty much every other state. They also have a market with fresh fruits, veggies, meat, etc. pretty much like any farmers market.

My favorite thing of the day? The Library of Congress...I guess in my mind I thought you walked in and BOOM the library is right there, but oh, turns out that once you walk in there's a foyer and great room with hallways that lead to small galleries. The building was stunning though. Between the paintings and mosaics, I was sold! We made it to the main reading room (just think National Treasure and Riley Poole getting blueprints to steal the Declaration of Independence) but just so you are aware, we saw it from one of the balconies...with a glass divider. I guess that makes sense because people are actually tying to do research and a million tourists would be the absolute worst to deal with. Still wish I could have walked on the floor.

> Commentary by Z: I guess National Treasure wouldn't have been as exciting if they went to the Library of Congress, walked through all the hallways and got to the glass paneled viewing station and said "Oh I didn't know we couldn't go in there" and went home.

We split from Lauren and Cameron so we could tour the rest of DC and do the things they've already done while they ran errands and did other stuff. We decided to walk to
- The National Archives Building
- Washington Monument
- WWII Memorial
- Korean War Veterans Memorials
- Lincoln Memorial
- Vietnam Veterans Memorial
- 56 Signers of the Declaration of Independence Memorial
- White House

It was quite a bit of walking and it didn't seem like a bad idea but it was cold and windy so by the end our faces were numb ha. It was definitely worth it though because each place was amazing! So much history in one city! It makes me sad that 1) we live so far away and 2) we did't have enough time to see everything.

### Where did we eat?
Crepes - at the Eastern Market Zack got donuts and I got a crepe. It was delicious and I would go back again and again! Just thinking about it now makes me want to get another one!

> Commentary by Z: 100% considering spending my tax return on one of those mini donut friers. They're amazing. Pretty sure I'd be the coolest person in my neighborhood and they'd all invite me over for parties.

DC Tacos - This place I believe started as a food truck and expanded to a store front. Their queso is one of my favorites ever..I don't know what their secret was but it was amazing!! You can build your tacos so I got 3 and tried one with chicken, one with steak, and one with barbacoa. All were really good buuut I think I liked the steak the best.

Baked and Wired - we tried this cool cupcake shop in Georgetown! We shared a red velvet cupcake (they are pretty big so sharing was plenty). It was really good, but probably not the best cupcake I have ever had. Still really good though!

### What do we wish we could have done?
We always leave a city without seeing everything (problems of only staying a few nights in one place). I really wanted to see Arlington National Cemetery, but we couldn't fit it in..Well we could have if I was willing to wake up at 6:30...but I wanted a little more sleep. Correction, I needed more sleep. These long days of running around were a little too much ha.

We also wished we could have seen more museums! There are so many in the city and we could spend forever just trying to hit all of them! I guess it's just another reason to come back...Until Next time DC.
