Sunday for Zack and me means going to church and even though we are on the road and obviously not attending our own congregation, we still think it's important to attend and make that a part of our life. So today we got to meet up with my aunt and her family and go to their meeting in the Charleston area! It's so amazing to have family and see them on this trip! Because they live so far away from us in Utah, we only get to see one another now and then during family reunions so it was great to go to church with them and hang at their place for a few hours.

They fed us, and these days I look forward to and crave home cooked meals. You know what I don't get enough of while on this trip?? Vegetables!! And dang I miss them, so when my aunt made a beef stew with veggies I was stoked!! As we left, Misty (my Aunt) sent us away with a dozen cupcakes and let me tell you, her cupcakes are my favorite!! She is a magician when it comes to baking them and I ALWAYS look forward to devouring them when we get together. She did not disappoint and I left so so happy :). I know she was trying to bribe us to stay and you know what? It kinda worked!

> Commentary by Z: Cupcakes are one of the greatest things on the planet because they're just cake to-go. And of all the cupcakes I've had, these are amongst the best!

Tonight we are staying with some friends - Zack's old roommate and his wife! They showed us their beach and gorgeous sunsets in South Carolina. In the first 2 minutes we were assaulted with little sandflies (no-see-ums as I call them) and all they wanted to do was attack our faces!! So nasty...I really don't like when they try to bite or fly into my eyes!! That really freaks me out! The lack of ocean breeze will bring them in from everywhere it seems, so we were going to turn around and call it quits but the sun went down and they left so we finished our walk.

> Commentary by Z: I grew up 10 minutes from the beach, but since I've been living in Utah for the past 10 years I forget how much I love it. This made me really want to find a home within a short drive of the coast.

For dinner our friends made Korean BBQ. It was the real deal with bean paste (didn't know that existed), kimchi (surprisingly good - you know, for being fermented cabbage), dumplings and of course, the BBQ itself. And for dessert??? Cupcakes!! It was authentic - something I could only dream of cooking (that's why I will leave it to the professionals).
