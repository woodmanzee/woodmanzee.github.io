There was a point right before this trip that Zack and I played with the idea of moving to Myrtle Beach. Both of us had never been but we heard it was a popular vacation spot and the thought of being near a beach was a appealing...so it was on our radar - but let me just say that prior to driving here, we had never even seen pictures of the place. Just hearsay of how great it is.

When we arrived I was a little surprised to see how touristy it was. It almost had an old Vegas feel. You know, the themed big resorts along the strip. Nooot what I was expecting. You could tell that maybe in the 80-90s it was this incredible place to get away but now things seem a little run down.

The beaches were beautiful though I will say! White sand and stretching for miles! Basically what it comes down to is it can in fact be a fun place to vacation - especially as a college student because you can rent a room for pretty cheap and then party on the beach - but this is not the place Zack and I would want to buy a home and settle down...but that's why we are doing this trip right?

The boardwalk was fun though and had the SkyWheel (the 5th largest ferris wheel in the US - thrilling huh??). Actually, a little not so secret of mine is that I hate Ferris Wheels. And why is it that every time I get on one, it stops at the very top! THE. VERY. TOP. Then you have to wait like 5 min as they board people...oh I hate it..but I do it anyway because I don't want to miss out on experiences. Did you ever see the movie "Mighty Joe Young"? I LOVED that movie but it also scarred me for life when the ferris wheel tipped over (spoiler alert)...now I always feel like mine will tip over too but I wont have a giant gorilla to save me...

> Commentary by Z: I'm not too hot with heights either, especially when I can see these thin metal supports holding up the tiny box I'm in. So why did we do this again? I will say that with every revolution of the wheel I got more comfortable, but of course as soon as I can really relax then the ride is over.

_We found a candy store. Zack found his true love_

For dinner we went to River City Cafe. If you want a burger, this place has more burger options than pretty much any other place. I just stared at the menu for several minutes not even sure where to begin. The walls of the cafe were covered in old license plates which was kinda fun. We tried to find a Utah plate but for the life of us could not find one. If anyone goes there..please find it for us. I _need_ to know were it is.

> Commentary by Z: There were some super interesting choices, like burgers with cheetos on it, or a "biscuit" of fried mac'n'cheese, or even a smores burger with chocolate and marshmallow on top. The most intense was the "kitchen sink" one... picture below@

_this was legit on the menu...uh what? How does one even go about eating something like that??_

We enjoyed our time in Myrtle Beach, but it's definitely not the place we're choosing to settle down. On to the next one!
