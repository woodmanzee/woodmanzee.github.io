### What did we do?

We left Vermont and headed to Chicago but split this up in a few days knowing that we had a few places we wanted to stop and see along the way. We wanted to see a few places that mean a lot to us in terms of our faith, so we stopped by some church history sites for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Palmyra, NY and Kirtland, OH. If you have more question about why these places are significant, you can go to https://history.lds.org/section/historic-sites?lang=eng and it will dive into the history a little more! For the sake of time, I won't go into the nitty gritty details, but the sites themselves were beautiful and it was interesting to learn more about the history behind the buildings.

> Commentary by Z: It also snowed like crazy and we were amazed anybody else was out there in that weather. Aaaand we asked a nice old man at the visitors center to give us the 10 minute version of the tour so he nicely cut his hour long tour down to only 45 minutes!

Along this drive we also stopped at Niagara Falls! I had been before but this was Zack's first time! It was...incredibly cold! Just another place we were reminded that it's still winter. We didn't have our passports with us because Zack had to renew his in preparation for Europe sooo we had to stay on American ground. The view was still amazing and because there were fewer people, we got a better view of the falls. Fun fact! Aaron Burr (you know from the musical Hamilton) had a daughter named Theodosia. Well, when she married, her and her husband honeymooned at Niagara and started the popular trend to make it a popular honeymoon destination. Who knew that Hamilton would teach us so many things throughout this trip!! Just another reason to love it more :)

### Where did we eat?

Saks Thai Cuisine Inc: We came here after visiting Palmyra. It was cold and snowy so the roads were bad. We keep making the mistake of saying we will eat lunch but then get busy with sight-seeing so we push lunch back until it is dinner time...this was another one of those times and so we were starving by the time we finished seeing the Sacred Grove, Hill Cumorah, and the Book of Mormon Publication Site. We both had curry here and my only complaint was that they didn't give us a lot of rice like thai restaurants normally do. They gave us huge bowls of curry and only a little rice so the proportions seemed off..I like plenty of rice with my curry.

Grillcheezerie Sandwich Shoppe: This place is in Ann Arbor, MI along the main street in town. Zack got the Piggy Mac (mac and cheese with pulled pork and BBQ) and I got the Shroom Sandwich (mushrooms were a main ingredient). Both were really good and the service was quick...buuut that also might have been because it was late (like just before closing late) and we were two of the few in there ha!

### Final Thoughts

The leg from Vermont to Chicago was cold and snowy most of the trip! The worst of it was the day we left for Chicago...what should have been a 4 hour drive turned into a 7 hour drive with horrible road conditions from the blizzard...ya we drove through a blizzard which wasn't the smartest buut we wanted to move on and see our friend in Chicago before he left for a trip.

> Commentary by Z: I was super disappointed because I really wanted to go check out Detroit, but the weather made it pretty much impossible. It's one of those cities that is well known and everyone talks about how much it's struggling right now, but I wanted to see it for myself! Maybe next time :/

Overall it was a still a lot of fun and I'm glad that we split this leg up so we had a little more time to see the things we did!
