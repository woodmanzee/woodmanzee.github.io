1 - Met In The Enclave Complex

during Ward Prayer when Hannah decided to sit alone on top of the clubhouse roof, and Zack decided to go and talk to her. We hit it off right away and talked long after Ward Prayer was over.
							
Hannah even got an early glimpse of life as a Woodmansee and came over to Zack's apartment for cake afterwards!

2 - Became Friends

over time, though we were part of different friend groups for awhile. Zack would have game nights so he could invite Hannah, even though she thought it was just to invite her roommate!

Things changed when we got a group to go stargazing for the first time. Even though there were around 10 people there, we just hit it off again and chatted	with each other the entire night.

3 - Went On Our "First" Date

to the Provo Recreation Center, of all places. Tanner Andre had the idea for a double date there, and then his date bailed and we ended up going on our own. Though we had been going out together for the previous few weeks, this was the first "official" date.

After going swimming and watching a movie, we ended the night with our first kiss.

4 - Said "I Love You"

for the first time by accident (Zack). When driving one night, Zack made an obscure movie quote - as usual - which Hannah followed up with the name of the movie. In obvious shock, Zack casually tossed out "Wow, I love you," which we then both said nothing about.

Later that night Hannah brought it up and Zack said he meant it. To which Hannah responded, "I love you too."

5 - Decided To Get Married</p>

even though Hannah felt like she wasn't ready. At first she wanted to wait until December, but that just wasn't going to fly. Things were moving pretty fast and she hadn't planned on getting married until 25 (who does that anyways?).

After (not much) discussion, we decided we wanted to take the plunge that summer.

6 - Met The Parents<

Hannah's parents flew into town for the sole purpose of meeting Zack (and Lindsey's then boyfriend), during which Zack surprised the entire family by asking Bob for permission to marry Hannah.

Hannah met Zack's parents during Valentines day weekend, while we took a trip to California and had dinner, saw Brian Regan, and ate lots of cake.

Both sets of parents love their future son/daughter-in-law!

7 - Got Engaged

in much the same way they started dating - while stargazing. Using Hannah's astronomy class as a pretense for going stargazing one night, we went up the canyon where we had a love-sac surrounded by candles waiting for us. Hannah knew what was happening when she saw it, but was nervous up until the time Zack popped the question. And she said yes!

8 - Got Married

Not yet!
