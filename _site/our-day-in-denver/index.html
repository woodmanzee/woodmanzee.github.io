    </header>

    <article class="post-content">
        <p>We only had a single day to spend in Colorado so we had to make the most of it! With that in mind we started off our day with… a run! Exactly what most people would do right? We gotta stay somewhat in shape with all this inevitable eating out. My aunt and uncle live in a brand new neighborhood on top of this nice big hill. Wonderful for the view of the city, horrible for running. Naturally we ran up it anyways. It was brutal, but we did it.</p>

<p>After the workout we headed into the city and onto 16th street, a downtown pedestrian strip with lots of food and shopping. We walked along the street with no real destination in mind. There’s something fun about not having an agenda and just wandering in whatever store catches your eye.</p>

<p>Zack found his happy place.</p>

<p>After an hour or two we checked out Union Station. It was amazing to see how the city has turned this old train hub into a very classy meet and greet slash hangout area, with leather chairs and nice wooden tables surrounded by little coffee and dessert shops.</p>

<p>For lunch, we went to a place called Avanti Food and Beverage just outside the city. When you walk in there’s a few different restaurants inside the building, but they’re all inside individual shipping containers. So it’s kind of like a food truck roundup but indoors and in shipping crates… kind of hard to describe! They had several different options (Schawarma - which I got - sushi, italian, american, etc) and some nice tables and benches in the middle. It had a very modern young-tech-town feel to it, I’d recommend you go if you’re in the area!</p>

<p>Today also turned out to be our trial and error day. We planned a few things (the Newman side of us) but not everything (the Woodmansee side of us - or at least the male Woodmansees!). We were left with a few more hours and so it slowed us a down a bit. We would find something we wanted to do but then found out that they were closed. Take a tour of the Pepsi Center? Closed 10min ago. Take a tour of the Hammond Candy Factory? Closed half an hour ago. Take a tour of the Denver Mint? Need a reservation ahead of time. It was really no big deal but we could have saved time driving to no where for a bit. That’s part of the fun though, right?</p>

<p>After much deliberation and driving around in circles while googling what was still open, we ended up at the house of the “unsinkable” Molly Brown. Naturally it was about to close, but we still saw the gorgeous exterior and went into the carriage-house-turned-gift-shop and the employees were nice enough to tell us a bit of the place’s history before shooing out the door so they could close up. Since everything in Denver was closed just to spite us, we decided to just walk around the State Capitol building grounds before calling it a day.</p>

<p>It was an exciting day and by the end we were ready to go back and hang out with family for the rest of the night.</p>
